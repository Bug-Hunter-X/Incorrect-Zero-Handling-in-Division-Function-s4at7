# Incorrect Zero Handling in Division Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrectly handling zero values in a division operation.

The original code (`bug.js`) contains a function that divides two numbers. However, it incorrectly handles the case where either input is zero. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates how to correctly handle zero inputs and provide more robust error handling.
